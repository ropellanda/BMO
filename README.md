# BMO
This is the software necessary for a Raspberry Pi Zero BMO.
BMO can talk to you, play videogames, tell jokes and delete important files!
Each folder contains instructions for individual setup, no order needed though!

### Voice
You can setup voice recognition by running ```./voicesetup``` on the command line.
